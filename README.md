# Cellular-Network-Parameters-Investigation-Using-Service-Mode
Analysis of RF parameters (RSRP, SINR, Cell ID) across various environments to evaluate cellular network performance and stability. Part of the Wireless and Radiotechnology Course 2026.


### Project Overview
This repository contains a technical investigation into how physical environments and building materials impact mobile network performance. By accessing the **Service Mode** on a smartphone, specific radio frequency (RF) parameters were captured and analyzed to determine their effect on connectivity reliability and data throughput.

### Objectives
* **Explore:** Use system diagnostic codes (*#0011# / *#4636#*) to view real-time cellular data.
* **Measure:** Record Signal Strength (**RSRP**), Signal Quality (**RSRQ/SINR**), and **Bandwidth** in different locations.
* **Analyze:** Evaluate how distance from towers and physical obstructions (concrete, glass) influence the handover between 5G and 4G technologies.
* **Document:** Present findings in a structured format suitable for network engineering analysis.

### Repository Contents
* `/images`: Screenshots of Service Mode data from various test environments (Indoors, Outdoors, Deep Building).
* `/data`: Tabulated measurement data comparing RSRP and SINR values.
* `Analysis`: A deep dive into the correlation between signal quality and network stability.
