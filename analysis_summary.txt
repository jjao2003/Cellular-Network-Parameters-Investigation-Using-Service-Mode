Summary of Environmental Impact:
1. Distance from Tower: RSRP inversely correlates with distance; however, indoors, distance is secondary to wall density.
2. Network Load: Observed fluctuations in Bandwidth (20MHz to 10MHz) suggest the network dynamically reallocates resources based on signal reliability.
3. Reliability: SINR below 5dB resulted in noticeable packet retransmission and slower load times.
